# merging-simulation
<br>This project is part of the exam for the course "Distributed Artificial intelligence" provided by University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
<br>The project is a Netlogo simulation of the algorithms proposed in <a href="https://github.com/severisilvia/merging-simulation/blob/main/A%20Novel%20Safe%20Merging%20Algorithm%20for%20Connected%20Vehicles.pdf">this</a> paper.
<br>The parameters used for the simulation are:
<ul>
  <li> aacc =  0.005</li>
  <li> adec =  0.15 </li>
  <li> τ= 1 </li>
  <li> Δxmin =  6 </li>
  <li> Top-speed = 0.5</li>
  <li> Max initial number of cars on main lane = 8 </li>
  <li> Max initial number of cars on secondary lane = 3</li>
  <li> Max number of cars on the main lane after some merging = initial number of cars on main lane + initial number of cars on secondary lane </li>
</ul>
