# merging-simulation
This project is part of the exam for the course "Distributed Artificial intelligence" provided by University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
The project is a Netlogo simulation of the algorithms proposed in this paper.
The parameters used for the simulation are:
*aacc =  0.005
*adec =  0.15
*τ= 1
*Δxmin =  6
*Top-speed = 0.5
*Max initial number of cars on main lane = 8
*Max initial number of cars on secondary lane = 3
*Max number of cars on the main lane after some merging = initial number of cars on main lane + initial number of cars on secondary lane
